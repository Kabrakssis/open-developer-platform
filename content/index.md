The **Open Developer Platform** (ODP) provides a set of online services and best practices to augment the developer experience of Foundation's project teams; it is mainly composed by two blocks:

1. A [project infrastructure](project-infrastructure/) that provides tools for building, reporting, publishing and other software development aspects
2. Platform-specific APIs that can be accessed by project teams from their local workstations for development and testing purposes (e.g. the [Foundation's Symphony Development Pod](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FM/Open+Developer+Platform#OpenDeveloperPlatform-TheFoundationDeveloperPod)).
