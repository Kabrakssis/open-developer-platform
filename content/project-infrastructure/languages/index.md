**[Python](https://www.python.org/)** is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics; you can browse the [Foundation hosted projects that use python](https://github.com/symphonyoss?language=python); packages are published on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) (PyPI), however they cannot be browsed by author, therefore packages must be either searched or accessed from links published on project's documentation pages.

## Publishing on Pypi
Pyhon packages can be easily installed using [`pip` or `easy_install`](https://packaging.python.org/pip_easy_install/); in order to publish a Python package to the Python Package Index, follow the [simple steps described on this blogpost](http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html).

That said, the Foundation is still working on a centralised, automated way to publish (and sign) Python packages so that they can be managed by Foundation Staff.
