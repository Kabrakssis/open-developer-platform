Permanent access to the ODP is available to all approved committers on Foundation-hosted open source projects, for as long as those committers are engaged with a project.  If you have a new project that's in the [process of being contributed](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FM/pages/62783509/Contribution), you can indicate in your [Project Contribution JIRA](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/projects/CONTRIB/issues/) that you'd like ODP access, and we will provision that as part of the contribution process.

The Foundation also provides temporary access to the ODP for some Foundation-sponsored coding events (hackathons, innovation challenges, and the like).  In these cases, the specifics of both eligibility and the duration that access will be provided will be described in the details of the event.

## Requesting access

### New committer on existing project
If you have just become a committer on an existing Foundation-hosted open source project, you should request that the project lead [create a new issue in JIRA](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10400&issuetype=10300) on your behalf, as follows:

1. **Project**: Open Developer Platform (ODP)
2. **Issue Type**: Request access to ODP
3. **Description**:
    4. Link to the project in the [Foundation's Github organisation](https://github.com/symphonyoss/)
    5. User info of the new committer(s) on the project (each committer will receive their own User Account):
        6. Name
        7. Surname
        8. Email
        9. Organisation

### New project
If your project is newly contributed to the Foundation, you can use the same basic process to register it in the ODP - the project lead should [create a new issue in JIRA](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10400&issuetype=10300), as follows:

1. Project: Open Developer Platform (ODP)
2. Issue Type: Request access to ODP
3. Description:
  4. Link to the project in the Foundation's Github organisation
  5. URL(s) of the Custom App(s) to be registered

### New contribution
During the [contribution process](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FM/pages/62783509/Contribution) to the Foundation, you should indicate in your CONTRIB JIRA that you wish to have ODP access, and provide the email address(es) of all project committers as well as the URL(s) of any Custom App(s) you wish to have registered.  These will be provisioned as part of the contribution process.
